# TakeMe BY FAMILITY
A platform that promotes services of assisted transport for children, the elderly, or people with reduced mobility. 
Walking, biking or by public transport, we promote new habits for easier days.

## Description and features 
TakeMe platform offers assisted transport services by monitors for the most dependent people such as children, the elderly and people with reduced mobility.
The transportation possibilities used can be as diverse as walking, biking or public transport - all options will always be assisted by a monitor. 
Our proposal is to offer services that are perceived by tutors as reliable and safe so that families can start adopting new mobility habits, which are healthier, sustainable and have a better impact on the urban community.
On the other hand, the platform is also an essential management tool for assisted transport services providers, allowing them to optimize resources and digitalize processes. 
We have designed an easy-to-use interface for monitoring the rides of the most dependent people, so that everyone has more mobility options and easier days.
